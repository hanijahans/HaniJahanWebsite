Starting the year by rebuilding the core.

# Restarting WorldLattice — The Necessary Rebuild

## Why I Restarted — And Why It Had To Happen
I restarted WorldLattice on purpose.

Not by cleaning things up, but by going back to zero and asking questions I avoided before:
- What is the **actual core loop**?    
- What must exist for this project to make sense?    
- What is signal, and what is noise?    

After multiple life resets, I learned this: restarts aren’t always about failure. Sometimes they’re about finally seeing the structure underneath.

I wrote more about this mindset in _[Game Dev Lessons from Drawing](/blog/gamedev-blog-01-game-dev-lessons-from-drawing)_ — and this devlog is the practical follow-through on that idea.  

## The Step I Skipped That Broke Everything

The structure I should have followed was always clear:
- **Step 1 — Messy Sketch → Prototype (itch.io)**    
- **Step 2 — Clean Core → Vertical Slice (Steam Demo)**    
- **Step 3 — Polish → Full Release**    

With WorldLattice, I nailed **Step 1**.  
I shipped a messy sketch as a playable prototype.
Then,
I **skipped Step 2** and jumped straight to polish.

I added features and polish on top of something that had no stable internal shape. I felt the friction, but ignored it — because progress looked like progress.

It wasn’t.

Skipping the structural phase caused predictable damage:
- My mental model of the project became blurry.    
- Systems worked individually but didn’t form a coherent whole.    
- I polished and optimized ideas that never should have survived the core phase.    

This restart isn’t about erasing work.  
It’s about removing complexity that grew without clarity.

Breaking things wasn’t the failure.  
Letting confusion accumulate was.

## The Detail Trap — And How It Derailed Me

How hard it is to see the core **once details exist**.

Details are seductive. They give you dopamine. They make you feel productive.  
Core work does the opposite — it’s slow, vague, and uncomfortable.

That discomfort is not a warning sign.  
It is the work.

Avoiding it is how projects drift, bloat, and quietly die.

Right now, I’m rebuilding WorldLattice as a clean, readable structure without decoration. 

I’ve deliberately forced myself into that uncomfortable second step:
- One unmistakable core loop    
- A small, coherent set of systems    
- Code that mirrors the design

This is the phase that could eventually become a Steam demo.  
This devlog exists because I wanted to show _this_ part — the part where it’s not flashy, but the spine is being rebuilt.

## What This Restart Actually Fixes

The short-term goal is **not** to surpass the old version.

The goal is to reach the _same functional point_:
- with fewer systems,    
- clearer rules,    
- and a foundation that actually supports growth.    

If this works, this restart becomes the path to a proper Steam demo — not a polished sketch pretending to be one.

## If You’ve Been Here Too

Have you ever restarted something — not because it failed — but because you finally understood what it was _supposed_ to be?

If you’ve hit that moment before, I’d like to hear more [WorldLattice Discord](https://discord.gg/GhakCXMtVy).


If this year is about anything for me, it’s rebuilding the core.  
Happy New Year.
